# Altitude Finance

Altitude (PWDR) is an evolutionary cryptocurrency that is pushing the limits of DeFi by combining yield farming, flash loans, and community governance.  

Typical DeFi tokens tend to benefit whales that get in early, where few can profit and the many are left holding the bag. We aim to change that paradigm so everyone can secure value through the combination of sustainable high-APR farming, flash loans for ongoing long-term value, and a cyclical mechanism to retain value through platform fees, locked liquidity, and rewards for stakers.
