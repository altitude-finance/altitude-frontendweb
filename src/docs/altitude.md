# Altitude Finance

The current yield farming landscape is one that encourages early entries while yields are high and quick exits as token supply increases, decreasing yield. This system is built to favor big players where few profit and many are left holding inflated tokens. Altitude (PWDR) is a high-yield cryptocurrency with cyclic tokenomics, supported by an arbitrage marketplace. This design is intended to combat the traditional quick-flip strategies and create an ecosystem that rewards long-term holders. The journey to financial freedom is not an easy one but it starts with the first foothold. Together, we will climb.

## Altitude Basics
- **Token Symbol:** ​PWDR  
- **Max Total Supply:** ​10,000,000  
- **Transfer Fee:** ​1.5%    
- **Flash Loan Fee:** 0.25% - 0.025%  
- **Yield Farming:​** PWDR is farmed by staking tokens in the **SLOPES**. Yield from the slopes is earned in *BOTH* the staked token and PWDR. During the initial distribution phase, PWDR tokens are rewarded to stakers every block using a fixed APY of 1,000%. All slopes only require a single token so there is *NO RISK* of impermanent loss (IL).  
- **Flash Loans:** Altitude **SLOPES** can be borrowed against by arbiters to create flash loans at a market leading rate. Fees from flash loans are used to reward stakers in the slopes.
- **Cyclic Tokenomics:** The **AVALANCHE** and **EVAPORATE** events are unique staking and burn events that create cyclical accumulation and distribution phases.
- **Arbitrage Loyalty Points:** To stay competitive in the current market, flash loans must be competitively priced. Altitude implements a tiered loyalty system where discounts are provided to arbiters who use the platform frequently, providing an increasingly cheaper source of arbitration.
- **NFT Item Boosts:** NFT series providing boosts for Altitude farming and arbitrage activities
- **Governance:** ​Extendable governance model. Initially a two-tier system, Greenhorn (admin) and Mountaineer (everyone).
