# Altitude Finance

The current yield farming landscape is one that encourages early entries while yields are high and quick exits as token supply increases, decreasing yield. This system is built to favor big players where few profit and many are left holding inflated tokens. Altitude (PWDR) is a high-yield cryptocurrency with cyclic tokenomics, supported by an arbitrage marketplace. This design is intended to combat the traditional quick-flip strategies and create an ecosystem that rewards long-term holders. The journey to financial freedom is not an easy one but it starts with the first foothold. Together, we will climb.
