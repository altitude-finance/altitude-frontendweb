# Altitude Finance

Altitude (PWDR) is an evolutionary cryptocurrency that is pushing the limits of DeFi by combining yield farming, flash loans, and community governance.  

Typical DeFi tokens tend to benefit whales that get in early, where few can profit and the many are left holding the bag. We aim to change that paradigm so everyone can secure value through the combination of sustainable high-APR farming, flash loans for ongoing long-term value, and a cyclical mechanism to retain value through platform fees, locked liquidity, and rewards for stakers. 

## Altitude Basics
- **Token Symbol:** ​PWDR  
- **Max Total Supply:** ​21,000,000  
- **Transfer Fee:** ​1.5%    
- **Flash Loan Fee:** 0.25% - 0.025%  
- **Yield Farming:​** PWDR is farmed by staking tokens in the **Slopes**. Yield from the slopes is earned in *BOTH* the staked token and PWDR. During the **initial distribution phase**, PWDR tokens are rewarded to stakers every block using a base fixed APY of **800%**. Future epochs change the fixed APR of the slopes per the PWDR Epoch Schedule. All slopes only require a single token so there is *NO RISK* of impermanent loss (IL).  
- **Flash Loans:** Developers can easily use Altitude's flash loans to borrow against the Total Value Locked (TVL) in the slopes at a market leading rate. Fees collected from these flash loans are used to reward stakers in the slopes.
- **Sustainable Tokenomics:** PWDR is released in **Epochs** with distinct *Accumulation* and *Distribution* phases. This cyclical emission strategy is designed to combat inflation and preserve PWDR value.
- **Loyalty Points:** To stay competitive in the current market, Flash Loans must be competitively priced. Altitude implements a tiered loyalty system where discounts are provided to developers who use the platform frequently, providing an increasingly cheaper source of Flash Loans.
- **NFT Item Boosts:** Exclusive NFT series releases that provide boosts for Altitude **Slopes** and **Flash Loan** activities.  
- **Governance:** ​Extendable governance model with a role-based implementation. Initially, necessary Altitude ecosystem roles set up to control access. In the future, governance will extend to accommodate public voting contracts and quorums.
- **Complete Upgradeability:** All Altitude contracts built with upgradeable contract logic, allowing the Altitude Ecosystem to evolve and meet the needs of network participants.
