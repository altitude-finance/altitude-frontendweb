# Tokenomics

Altitude strives to have a fair distribution of PWDR tokens while balancing the benefits of a structured initial liquidity event. 

## LGE

Length: 5 Days
Start Date: Dec. 4th, 2020
Hard Cap: 2000 ETH
Individual Donation Cap: 20 ETH


The Liquidity Generation Event (LGE) aims to bootstrap liquidity on Uniswap and ensure future sustainability. Anyone can donate Ethereum to the LGE contract at a max rate of 20 ETH per address. Addresses that donate to the LGE will receive PWDR tokens at a rate of 1 ETH:X PWDR upon completion of the event.

Addresses that donate 20/15 ETH also are eligible to receive an NFT which grants boosts across the Altitude network. NFTs are limited in quantity. See the NFT page for more info [link]().

## Transfer Fee

Whenever PWDR is transferred, a **1.5%** Fee is incurred. This 1.5% is split between Token Buybacks and the Altitude Treasury at a ratio of X:Y. Token Buybacks are used to reward stakers in the Avalanche and Slopes. PWDR Tokens sent to the Altitude Treasury will be used for future sustainability of the project.
