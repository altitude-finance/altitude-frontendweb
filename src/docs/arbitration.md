# Arbitration

Developers and price arbiters can utilize the liquidity generated from the Slopes by deploying contracts which perform Flash Loans. When arbitration through flash loans happens via Altitude, arbiters are charged a market leading fee to complete the transaction. Loyalty Points are rewarded on successful transactions, which incentivizes usage and rewards arbiters with an increasingly profitable source of arbitration.

## Flash Loans

Flash Loans are special types of transactions which only occur on the blockchain. Borrowers can use funds from the slopes for a nominal fee as long as they are paid back before the next block occurs. Since Ethereum state prevents transactions 

## Loyalty Points

Each time a successful flash loan is performed in Altitude, loyalty points are awarded to the arbiter. Loyalty points are rewarded proportionally to the fees paid to the pool size.
