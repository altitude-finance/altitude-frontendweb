## Altitude NFT Bonuses
Altitude uses various NFTs to provide boosts in network farming and borrowing activities. NFTs are unique, one-of-a-kind tokens. 

Altitude will create one set of NFTs at launch and release new NFTs periodically. Once a particular NFT set has been released, no more NFTs from that set will be minted ever again.
