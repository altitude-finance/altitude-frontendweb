# NFTs

Altitude uses various NFTs to provide boosts in network farming and borrowing activities. NFTs are unique, one-of-a-kind tokens. Altitude will create one set of NFTs at launch and release new NFTs periodically. Once a particular NFT set has been released, no more NFTs from that set will be minted ever again. 

## Altitude Snowboards

During the LGE, an initial set of NFTs will be rewarded to any address which contributes 20, 15, 10 ETH to the LGE event, on a first-come, first-serve basis. This initial set is composed of **10 Gold Snowboards**, **20 Silver Snowboards**, and **30 Bronze Snowboards**. Any NFTs not claimed during the LGE will be listed on OpenSea for auctioning.
