# Liquidity Generation Event

Altitude strives to have a fair distribution of PWDR tokens while balancing the benefits of a structured initial liquidity generating event.
The Liquidity Generation Event (LGE) aims to bootstrap liquidity on Uniswap and ensure future project sustainability. Anyone can contribute Ethereum to the LGE contract at a max rate of 20 ETH per address. Addresses that contribute to the LGE will receive PWDR tokens at a minimum rate of 1 ETH:1312.5 PWDR upon completion of the event. 

Details of the event are as follows:
- Length: 5 Days Maximum
- Start Date: Dec. 4th, 2020 
- Hard Cap: 2000 ETH 
- Individual Contribution Cap: 20 ETH
- PWDR LGE Supply: 2.625M PWDR

*If the Hard Cap of 2000 ETH is reached before the end of the event, the LGE function can be called by anyone at the next occurrence of 1PM EST/6PM UTC.*

PWDR Tokens will be distributed evenly amongst contributors.

PWDR will be available on Uniswap following the conclusion of the LGE event window and the [Slopes](slopes.md) will open.

**NFTs Issued during LGE**

Addresses that contribute 20 ETH or  15+ ETH also are eligible to receive a Gold or Silver NFT which grants boosts across the Altitude ecosystem. NFTs are limited in quantity and available on a first-come, first-served basis. See the [NFTs section (The Lodge)](lodge.md) for additional details.
