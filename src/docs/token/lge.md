# Liquidity Generation Event

Altitude strives to have a fair distribution of PWDR tokens while balancing the benefits of a structured initial liquidity generating event.
The Liquidity Generation Event (LGE) aims to bootstrap liquidity on Uniswap and ensure future project sustainability. Anyone can contribute Ethereum to the LGE contract at a max rate of 20 ETH per address. Addresses that contribute to the LGE will receive PWDR tokens at a minimum rate of 1 ETH:1312.5 PWDR upon completion of the event. 

Details of the event are as follows:
- Length: 7 Days Maximum
- Est. Start Date: Dec. 14th, 2020 
- Hard Cap: 2000 ETH 
- Individual Contribution Cap: 20 ETH
- PWDR LGE Supply: 2.625M PWDR

*If the Hard Cap of 2000 ETH is reached before the end of the event, the LGE function can be called by anyone at the next occurrence of 1PM EST/6PM UTC.*

PWDR Tokens will be distributed evenly amongst contributors.

PWDR will be available on Uniswap following the conclusion of the LGE event window and the [Slopes](../slopes) will open.

## NFTs Issued during LGE

Addresses that contribute 20 ETH or 15+ ETH also are eligible to receive a Gold or Silver NFT which grants boosts across the Altitude ecosystem. NFTs are limited in quantity and available on a first-come, first-served basis. See the [Lodge](../lodge) for additional details.

## Initial Token Distribution

During the LGE, 5.25 million tokens (25% of the total supply) will be minted. 

Of that 25%, half (2.625M PWDR) will go to LGE contributors and the remaining half (2.625M PWDR) will be provided as locked Uniswap Liquidity.

The remaining 15.75M token supply will be distributed during each Epochâ€™s Accumulation phase.  PWDR will be distributed to everyone that has staked tokens in one of Slopes, the Altitude farming/staking contracts.
