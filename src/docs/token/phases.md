# Phases

## Accumulation
The first Epoch and Accumulation phase begins when the LGE is completed. During
the first Accumulation phase, 8 Million PWDR will be minted and rewarded to
stakers in the Slopes.  

PWDR rewards are allocated using a fixed APR calculation. As the price of PWDR
increases, the Slope will mint less PWDR per block. The same is true in reverse; if the
price of PWDR decreases, the amount minted increases. Since APRs are fixed, the
duration of this phase is variable. The goal of this stage is to provide a strong
foundation for the Avalanche by distributing PWDR based on fairness and network
contributions.  

During this stage, all PWDR collected from transfer and staking fees will accumulate
in a vault contract. Once the fixed amount of PWDR is minted for the Epoch, a
Distribution phase begins.  

## Distribution
The Distribution phase rewards long-term holders and stakers in the Altitude
Ecosystem. During this phase, PWDR tokens that are accumulated in the previous
phase are distributed to ETH/PWDR LP holders that stake in the Avalanche.  

Each Distribution phase lasts 20 days. Alternating between cycles of fixed emission
and fixed time periods allows the Altitude Ecosystem to self-correct for inflationary
pressures.
