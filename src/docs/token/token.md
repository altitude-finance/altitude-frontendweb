# PWDR Basics

Altitude strives to have a fair distribution of PWDR tokens while balancing the benefits of a structured initial liquidity event. A fixed amount of **5.25M** PWDR is minted for the initial liquidity event, while the remaining supply of **15.75M** PWDR tokens will be distributed based on a fixed APR formula detailed in the [Slopes Section](./slopes).

## Transfer Fee

Whenever PWDR is transferred, a **1.5%** Fee is incurred. This 1.5% is split between Token Buybacks and the Altitude Treasury at a ratio of X:Y. Token Buybacks are used to reward stakers in the Avalanche and Slopes. PWDR Tokens sent to the Altitude Treasury will be used for future sustainability of the project.
