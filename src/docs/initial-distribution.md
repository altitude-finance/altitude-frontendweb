# Initial Token Distribution

During the PWDR making [Liquidity Generation Event](lge.md), 5.25 million tokens (25% of the total supply) will be minted. 

Of that 25%, half (2.625M PWDR) will go to LGE contributors and the remaining half (2.625M PWDR) will be provided as locked Uniswap Liquidity.

The remaining 15.75M token supply will be distributed during each Epochâ€™s Accumulation phase.  PWDR will be distributed to everyone that has staked tokens in one of Slopes, the Altitude farming/staking contracts.
