# Avalanche 

Once the max token supply is reached, the PWDR/ETH LP Slope will be converted into the Avalanche. The Avalanche is a unique staking pool in the Altitude ecosystem which rewards liquidity providers and incentivizes long-term holding. The Avalanche only accepts PWDR/ETH Uniswap LP tokens and rewards PWDR. This pool cannot be borrowed against.
