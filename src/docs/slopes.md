# Slopes

The Slopes are the farming and lending pools in Altitude. When staking tokens in the Slopes, interest in earned in the form of PWDR tokens and the staked ERC20 token. Developers and Price Arbiters can borrow against the slopes by performing flash loans. 

All Slopes, with the exception of the PWDR-ETH LP Slope, have no risk of impermanent loss. Since the PWDR-ETH LP Slope is unique, different parameters are applied to this pool and it cannot be borrowed against.

## Fixed APR Farming

During the initial distribution phase, Slopes have a base fixed APR of 1000%. This does ​not​ guarantee a 1000% return for investors. It simply means more PWDR gets rewarded to stakers if the price drops during the distribution phase. The max supply prevents fixed APR Slopes from becoming unsustainable.
