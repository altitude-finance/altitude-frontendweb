# Avalanche Basics

â€‹The Avalanche is a unique staking pool in the Altitude ecosystem which rewards Liquidity Providers and incentivizes long-term holding. The Avalanche only accepts PWDR/ETH Uniswap LP tokens and rewards PWDR. The Avalanche opens when the max token supply of the first Epoch is minted (PWDR #13,250,000) and rewarded. At this time, the PWDR/ETH LP Slope will close and the Avalanche will begin accepting deposits. Stakers in the PWDR/ETH LP Slope can migrate their tokens once this phase has been reached. This pool cannot be borrowed against.

## Avalanche Rewards

All PWDR collected from the previous Accumulation phase via transfer fees, staking fees, or other means is rewarded to Avalanche stakers.

During the Distribution phase, rewards from the Avalanche are paid out **daily** over the course of **20 days**. Once this period has ended, PWDR will resume minting according to the Epoch schedule to both the Slopes and the Avalanche.

**NOTE:** Once the 6th and final epoch occurs, the maximum supply of 21,000,000 PWDR will be reached and no further PWDR will be minted. The fixed APR model will sunset and PWDR rewards will instead be distributed directly to the Avalanche.
