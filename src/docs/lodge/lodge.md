# Lodge Basics

Altitude uses the Lodge NFTs to provide boosts in staking and lending activities. NFTs are unique, one-of-a-kind tokens. 

Altitude will create one set of NFTs at launch and release new NFTs periodically. Once a particular NFT set has been released, no more NFTs from that set will be minted ever again.

NFTs must be staked to receive bonuses. You can stake your NFT by visiting the [Lodge](../lodge), approving the staking contract, and then depositing your NFT. You will claim any pending rewards in the Avalanche or Slopes if they are available.
