# Flash Loans

## What are Flash Loans?

Flash Loans are special types of transactions which only occur on the blockchain. Flash Loans are uncollateralized loans which allow developers to instantly access liquidity for a small fee. Borrowers can use funds from the Slopes as long as they are paid back within one block. If the transaction is not completed within one block and all borrowed funds plus the fee are not paid back, it is completely reversed. This ensures that funds remain safe and depositors are able to withdraw at any time.

## Flash Loan Fees

Whenever a developer wants to take a Flash Loan, they must pay a fee to complete the transaction. The fee amount is based on their Loyalty Points deatiled in the [Loyalty Section](./loyalty). This fee is evenly split among all stakers in the Slope.
