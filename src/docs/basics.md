## Altitude Basics
- **Token Symbol:** ​PWDR  
- **Max Total Supply:** ​10,000,000  
- **Transfer Fee:** ​1.5%    
- **Flash Loan Fee:** 0.25% - 0.025%  
- **Yield Farming:​** PWDR is farmed by staking tokens in the **SLOPES**. Yield from the slopes is earned in *BOTH* the staked token and PWDR. During the initial distribution phase, PWDR tokens are rewarded to stakers every block using a fixed APY of 1,000%. All slopes only require a single token so there is *NO RISK* of impermanent loss (IL).  
- **Flash Loans:** Altitude **SLOPES** can be borrowed against by arbiters to create flash loans at a market leading rate. Fees from flash loans are used to reward stakers in the slopes.
- **Sustainable Tokenomics:** The **AVALANCHE** and **EVAPORATE** events are unique staking and burn events that create cyclical accumulation and distribution phases.
- **Arbitrage Loyalty Points:** To stay competitive in the current market, flash loans must be competitively priced. Altitude implements a tiered loyalty system where discounts are provided to arbiters who use the platform frequently, providing an increasingly cheaper source of arbitration.
- **NFT Item Boosts:** NFT series providing boosts for Altitude farming and arbitrage activities
- **Governance:** ​Extendable governance model. Initially a two-tier system, Greenhorn (admin) and Mountaineer (everyone).
